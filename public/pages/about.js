    <li>Eliminate labor.</li>
    <li>Create abundance.</li>
    <li>Solve survival.</li>

<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Is it possible to create a balanced distribution of resources? 
Either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a> is an inherit feature of reality or a human construct. 
If it's a human problem, then it is solved over time with evolution. 
If it is a feature of reality then it is solved by breaking and reforming reality.
To test this we need to remove the incentives that cause imbalanced resource distributions. 
The primary incentives are the time and energy required to attain and sustain life.
Therefore when the time and energy problem is solved then we can test the distribution problem. 

The solution to the time and energy problem right now seems to be automation.
I am dedicating my time and energy to realizing automation which seems to be the best solution to achieving a sustainable <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html">fly wheel effect</a> that can persist.
